# Quick introduction to our project!
Hello! This is a README.md file made with the intention of being read before booting our project up! 

# Things to mention when you start
So one thing that is noteworthy is the fast that when you press a new game, you will find that there is no NetworkManager HUD - or at least, Mirrors OWN HUD, that is because we have customized it to fit with our UI!

For that reason, it may seem a bit weird if you're expecting to see that - but it is there! Just customized to fit our needs! Another thing to note is that our hud doesn't contain the usual port system, that is because... in the network manager you can change the port! (We didn't think of it when we made the UI).

Another thing is that we have a "Pin-code" system! Please make sure to write 4 letters/numbers in total, there is a limit and if anything is to go wrong (can't load up the saved character), then please make sure to try making a new character with a pin that ONLY consists of numbers!
(It SHOULD work without any issues if you use letters, BUT in case there are any issues, try switching to ONLY using numbers thank you <3) 
The data is saved in the database and by using the pin-code you can access the data! 

## Booting up the game
When you press on the new game button, it will show some different options, the ones that we're gonna note are username, pin-code, character "class" and host check. 

Username is... well, the name that the user will use in game.
The pin-code is a 4 letter/number code that is if you wanna save your progress (press the ESC key in game). 

There are 4 different classes in our game, these are the following classes: 
* Gunner Tank - The standard tank in our game! 
* Sniper Tank - Shoots slower bullets but have a farther reach! 
* Big Gun Tank - Shoots slower bullets with a shorter reach but they do more damage!
* Machine Gunner Tank - Shoots many bullets at the same time but they don't have good reach and do less damage!

Make sure to check one of the characters! 

When you're creating a new game, make sure to check whether or not you're gonna be the host! If you are the host, then make sure that it is checked! If you aren't the host, then make sure it is not checked!

## In Game
So here is a screenshot of what the game looks like, i'll be quickly going over what you're seeing!:

So firstly, is your tank! This is the tank you will be controlling with either the arrow keys OR WASD, you use the mouse to rotate and aim and the left mouse button click to shoot! 
The next thing is the minimap! It shows where the other players are if they are near you! -NOTE! IT DOES NOT SHOW ENEMIES! 
Final thing is your upgrades! Once you start the game and you have killed some enemies, there will be a window that pops up to the left side that will show you, what your current level of attributes are as well as give you the opportunity to level up your attributes! You decide what you wanna do with your points so you can level up your character however you want!
